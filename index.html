        <h3>Personality Types</h3>
        <p>Among our group we have a variety of personality types, with the information available about these personality types we can ascertain how we may operate as a group collective.We have leader types to propel the group forward and keep communication open, a support type to offer assistance to group members who may be struggling and keep us on track, an assertive logistician type to create and maintain a direct plan of action, and a virtuoso type who will be willing to explore ideas and concepts other may not be so quick to identify.</p>

        <h3>Learning Styles</h3>
        <p>We have a variety of learning types in our group also, this will be extremely beneficial in the sense that we will be able to assist each other on topics of study. If somebody in the group is unable to grasp a concept due to the manner in which it is presented the chance of others being able to explain it is far greater than if we all possessed the same learning style.</p>

        <h3>Individual Tests</h3>
        <p>The separate tests undertaken is a good insight to what we each can bring to the group outside of the standard learning conventions. Whether it be high situational awareness or and openness to delve into all aspects of working as a team, they show that we can each offer a unique trait to this group environment.</p>

        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>Upon creating our group, for this and future assignments, on Canvas we opened a discussion thread about the best, most effective, ways to move forward with communication. We all agreed that a tool like MS Teams would be extremely beneficial as a main communicating tool for us. For such activities as this, the ease of communicating ideas via text, video, and calls would be easy and we would also have the means to share and edit files.</p>

        <p>Tools used for this assignment:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li>Canvas â€“ For immediately visible, urgent, announcements</li>
            <li>MS Teams â€“ For general exchange of ideas, files, and video conferencing</li>
            <li>Trello â€“ For more in-depth scheduling and a visual tool of what needs to be accomplished</li>
            <li>GitHub â€“ For basic organisation of ideas</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Although the GitHub repository was utilised to organise and upload files and information, the audit does not accurately reflect the work that was done. As it was mainly used as a storage and organisational tool it does not reflect the discourse and file sharing that took part during this project. Our ability to employ the benefits of other tools such as Teams and Trello made the use and reliance on the GitHub repository minimal.</p>
